      - open the floor may cap at 5-10 mins per section so we can get through all our sections.

      - USE NOTE AS A REFERENCE!
      - WHOS TAKING NOTES!! strongl recommend ...active learning... at least question/look into more points

      # Chapter 1 & 2 Questions?

      ---

      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 3:] IAM & EC2

      - Regions vs Availability Zones
        - Regions: a geographic area, reduce latency, have 2 or more data centers
        - Availability Zones (AZ): the represenation of a data center
        - Some services are regional (EC2, RDS) and some are global (R53, IAM)
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/"><img src="images/slides/phase1/aws_global_infra.png" alt="" width="650" /></a>

        ???
        - What region are yall using?
      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 3:] IAM & EC2
      - IAM = Identity and Access Management
        - acces control for all AWS people (users + groups) and resources (ec2, rds, etc)
        - least privilege access
        - one user per person
        - one role per application
        - **never** share iam creds or save them in github/code
        - never use the root credentials

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 3:] IAM & EC2
      - EC2 is the _powerhouse_ and _fundamentals_ of AWS compute
        - Virtual machine where you pick your CPU & RAM (**instance type**), OS (AMI), storage (ebs volume), and security (security groups)
        - Ssh into our instance via port 22 (**exam question on modifying pem file permissions**)
        - Configure/bootstrap our instance via user data


      - Security Groups: fundamentals of AWS security
        - define rules for inbound & outbound traffic on specific ports
        - timeouts are almost always security group issues

      ???
      - review instance reservations (reserved, spot,on demand, dedicated, dedicated host)
      - review instance types (R, C, M, I, G,t2/t3)

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 3:] IAM & EC2
      - Private, Public and Elastic IPs
        - IPv6 (2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) and IPv4 (172.16.254.1.)
        - Public IP: machine can be identified on the internet (unique across the entire web)
        - Private IP: machine can be identified on/accessed on a pirivate network (uqnique within subnet range for network)
        - Elastic IP: give a fixed **public IP **

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 3:] IAM & EC2
      - ENI: Elastic Network Interface
        - logical represnetation of a virtual network card
        - enables attachment of primary private IP, secondary primary IP, MAC address, SGs
        - Can only attach a public IP as inital eth0 (on machine startup ec2 is assigned an ENI with a public IP)

      ???
      - IPs are our address to our machines
      - this is where i stumble a bit
      - avoid using ips ... use dns or lbs
      - 3 elastic ips per account

      # Chapter 3 Questions?

      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 4:] ELB & ASG

      We want to enable **vertical** scalability (increase size m4.large -> m4.xlarge).

      We want to enable **horizantal** elasticity (1 instance to 4 instances).

      We want to enable high availability (survivial of a data center or region outage).

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 4:] ELB & ASG

      - Elastic Load Balancer: single dns or ip entry point that routes traffic to various backends (technically is a server under the hood)
        - Enable elasticitiy and high availability
        - Classic Load Balancer: layer 4 (TCP) and layer 7 (HTTP) communication that routes traffic to fixed hosts **legacy/depricated **
        - Application load balancer: layer 7 (HTTP) communication that routes traffic to various target groups and can perform health checks
        - Network load balancer: layer 4 (TCP) communication that provides high throughput and low latency routing to target groups
        - Stickiness & cross zone balancing are important features to remember!

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 4:] ELB & ASG

      - Autoscaling group: scales ec2 instances to match increased or decreased load
        - Enables elasticity and high availability (sort of)
        - Launch Templates vs Launch Config: both provide information on what the instance should look like when it comes up.
        - 3 scaling policies: target tracking scaling, simple/step scaling, scheduled action


      ???
      - launch tempalte = new + spot fleet + versiong
      - launch config = old + one instance type

      Other load balancers (HAProxy)

      Anyone have a good network layer explination?

      SSL/TLS

      Has anyone confured their own cert in ACM?

      A fun story about load balancer warming!

      ALB Web socket connections?

      Whats a use case for ASG lifecycle hooks?
