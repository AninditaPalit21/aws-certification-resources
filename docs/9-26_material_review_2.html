        - infinite scale
        - globally unique buckets
        - not a directory/ file system , just key value pairs
        - versioning
        - presigned vs public urls
        - used to host static websites
        - read after write consistency on PUTs for new objects
        - eventually consistent on DELETE/PUTs of existing objects
      ???
      - main buiolding blocks of aws

      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 9:] Amazon S3 Contd

      - 4 encryption methods:
        - SSE-S3: keys managed by AWS completely (AES-256)
        - SSE-KMS: keys managed by AWS KMS service
        - SSE-C: keys managed by you
        - client-side-encyrption: application does the encrypting

      - Bucket Policies:
        - define what princples can and cant do on your bucket resources
        - json based
        - lots of fun security use cases
      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 9:] Amazon S3 Contd

      - CORS: cross origin resource sharing
        - origin = scheme/protocol + host/domain + port
        - how your browser implements its own security
        - we must say our secondary resource is allowed to be accessed from our first resource

        - how to interact with aws resources programatically
        - installation
        - NEVER store personal creds anywhere to use CLI <small>except your personal machine</small>

      - IAM Roles: attached to services to define what they can and cant do
        - policies define the rules for a given role
        - can attach one role to many services, but should define one role per service (LEAST PRIVILEGE!)
        - best to create your own



      ???
      - who uses the cli?
      - how are keys managed?
      ---

        - only callable within aws network (aka on ec2)
        - MEMORIZE !! 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data

      - SDK: software development kit
        - supports most languages
        - enables interaction with aws resources in code
        - DEFAULT CREDENTIAL PROVIDER CHAIN <small> never store secrets</small>

      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 12:] Cloudfront & Global Accelerator

      - Cloudfront: content delivery network
        - improves perfomrance
        - content cached and distributed via edge locations
        - DDOS, shield, WAF, geo resitriction protection
        - can have s3 origin or custom http origin (alb, ex2, s3 website, http backend)

      - Cloudfront security:
        - S3: origin access identity (gives cloudfront permission to a particular bucket)
        - http backentds: security groups must allow ALL of the cloudfront IPs and should be publically accessable
        - signed urls/ cookies for access to a specific file (url) or multiple files (cookie) for a set time

      ???
      cloudflare vs cloudfront
      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 12:] Cloudfront & Global Accelerator Contd

      - Global Accelerator - reduces public interenet network hops to get to aws network/resources as quickly as possible
        - get 2 anycast IPs that will send user to closes edge location

      ???
      everyone understand any cast vs unicast??

      - Snowball : move lotssss of data with a physical transfer solution
        - snowball: TBs or PBs of data
        - snowball edge: perform computations while moving data (cleaning, transforming)
        - snowmobile: exabytes of data transfered... you get a whole truck!
        - must import to s3 first, can move to glacier with lifecycle policy

      - Storage gateway: give access to properitary aws services via industry standard apis
        - file gateway: s3 buckets accessible via NFS or SMB
        - volume gateway: ebs volumes accessable via ISCSI protocol
        - tapes : virtual tape librarys accessible via ISCSI protocol (glacier??)
        - file gateway hardware appliance: the appliance is NOT virtual for small data centers with no virtual capabilities

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 13:] Storage Xtras Contd

      - FSx for windows:  like EFS but for windows (since EFS ris for shared POSIX systems on linux only)
        - mutli az
        - backup to s3
        - accessible on prem

      - FSx for Luster: parallel distributed file system

      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 14:] Integrations & Messaging

      Synchronus communication vs asynchronus communication

      - SQS: simple queue service (fully managed cloud queue)
        - producers send messages to a queue which are read by consumers
        - consumers poll for messgages
        - unlimted throughput and messaging capacity
        - at least once delivery
        - best effort ordering EXCEPT with FIFO (but only one consumer then...)
        - encyrption in flight and at rest
        - ASG consumers via cloud watch metric on queue length
        - message visibility timeout !!!
        - DLQ
        - Delay Queue
      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 14:] Integrations & Messaging Contd

      - SNS: simple notifcation service (fully managed pub sub mechanism)
        - producers send message to a topic, which broadcasts to mutltiple subscribers
        - subsribers are pushed messgages
        - subscribers can be: sqs, https, lamdba, email. SMS, mobile
        - encyrption in flight and at rest
        - FAN OUT ARCHITECTURE! SNS + SQS


      ???
      did not understand this at first

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 14:] Integrations & Messaging Contd

      - Kinesis: managed alternative to apache kafka (big data streaming tool)
        - kinesis stream: low latency streaming ingest... data highway with reprocess and replay capability
        - kinesis analytics: real time analytics with sql
        - kinesis firehose: load stream into other AWS services (s3, redsshift, elasticsearch, splunk)

      - Kinesis Stream:
        - made of many shards
        - data is ordered per shard
        - the partition key of data determine the shard ID
        - set a highly distributed partition key in order to avoid a "hot partition"
        - KCL (kinesis client library) to consume from stream efficiently
      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 14:] Integrations & Messaging Contd

      - Amazon MQ: for traditional apps to migrate to the cloud using open queue protocols
        -  dont need to rearchtiect for AWS proprietary solutions
        - AMQP, CQTT , STOMP protocols

      S3

      Dynamo

      Cognito

      API Gateway

      SNS/SQS

      Kinesis Firehose

      Aurora Serverless

      Step Functions

      Fargate</small>


      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 15:] Serverless Contd

      - Lambda: virtual functions in the cloud
        - no servers, on demand running, automated scaling
        - 15 min run time max... other limits to be aware of
        - up to 3gb of RAM
        - node, python, java, c#, go, ruby, custom runtime

      - Lambda Egde: lamda deployed along with CDN @ edge locations

      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 15:] Serverless Contd

      - Dynamo DB - serverless database
        - nosql - made of tables with a primary key
        - multi az, auto scaling
        - must set independed Read / Write capacity limits (RCU & WCU)...unless running on demand (2X cost)
        - introduced idea of transcations !
        - global tables for multi region replication
        - streams (stream = changelog) to be read by lambda

      - DAX: dynamo db Accelerator
        - automatic caching for dynamo
        - prevent hot key (too many reads) problem
        - 10 nodes max per cache cluster
      ---
      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 15:] Serverless Contd

      - API Gateway: managed service to create endpoints on various backends
        - websocket, versioning, authentication built in support
        - provision multiple environments
        - swagger docs to import and export
        - api keys to throttle requests
        - integrate with: lambda, http backend, aws services
        - endpoint types: edge optimized, regional, private

      ## .wwcodebold[Chapter 16:] Serverless Architecture

      Putitng it all together!

      - dont store credentials with users
      - think through how to optimize cost throughput
      - OAI ... dont forget this is how cloudflare -> s3 auth works
      - Microservice architecture enables us to use serverless and traditional server choices
      - Will need to create a lot of little services in serverless (creating signed urls service etc)
      - Cloudfront = easy cost effective solution for static content caching globally
